Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Youzhi",
             family = "Yu",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),
             email = "yuyouzhi666@icloud.com"))
Description: Unicodes are not friendly to work with, and not all Unicodes are
    Emoji per se, making obtaining Emoji statistics a difficult task. This
    tool can help your experience of working with Emoji as smooth as possible,
    as it has the 'tidyverse' style.
