"It’s this intentionality that matters — otherwise, a brand stands for nothing more than a logo, tagline and supporting visuals."
"Finally, a brand can easily be perceived as disingenuous when it takes a stand  projects a voice if at the core it can’t live up to the basic tenets of value, quality, meaning  experience."
"When we ask a CMO and their team to deliver increases in sales volume, improvement in Net Promoter Score (NPS), etc. while not addressing quality, timeliness, product innovation, etc., it’s the equivalent of pushing a boulder uphill."
ONLYFANS I ever paid for was at Walmart
"A brand is complex — built from an intricate interdependency of vision, leadership, quality, value, support and aspiration. The digital world easily exposes the weakest connections within the brand ecosystem."

"1) Thanks Trump for keeping your word on protecting 2A with SCOTUS
2) Holding the Senate in GA is very important for protecting 2A as we’d need to block court packing or NFA legislation
3) Without the Senate, Biden attempting to expand NFA would help R’s take the house in 2022"
"If properly gamed, an incoming Biden admin would first need to pack the court to successfully EO their way into this proposed gun restrictions. Or they would need to win a senate majority in GA and pass it through Congress."
"Biden may attempt to expand NFA to include ARs, a gambit of other rifles and their magazines but doing so would immediately go to courts. Precedent SCOTUS rulings, and having a 2A friendly majority would almost assuredly mean 2A restrictive EOs are a nonstarter."
"For example, suppressors don’t make gun silent, more accurate or deadlier. A 9” barrel on an AR isn’t any easier to conceal in 2020 clothing than a 16” barrel. Most of the original intent of NFA is obsolete in today’s world but it’s still intact and won’t change anytime soon."
"This was originally designed to burden/deter organized crime using “Tommy guns” under trench coats. The price, $200 hasn’t changed. Today it functions as a deterrent to uneducated and poor Americans. Giving a “ruling class” much easier access to otherwise common firearms."
"love when a mf act like they don’t care, you met your match❤️."

have more confidence in your brand
The test is that almost everyone muted me and that only when people from my most inner circle of interaction do anything to the posts will it be seen by others as I only get likes after they've liked it etc.

"So, let’s look at what drives capitalism and in particular, what’s created the Achilles heel within the U.S. version of capitalism today. The key measures include:
• Liquidity ratios
• Leverage Financial Ratios
• Efficiency Ratios
• Profitability Ratios
• Market Value Ratios"
"in the overarching approach to what we define“capitalism” as today. Outside of Wall Street, private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) utilize the same criteria for investments and expectations for returns on capital with varying requirements."
"the insights regarding demands are compelling.
Let’s start with the fact that Wall Street is comprised of banks, securities traders and hedge funds, among others. It’s these firms that drive the vast majority of corporate decisions and it’s these decisions that are reflected"
"You’re thinking “insatiable demands” means consumption, but actually the insatiable demands are reflected in Wall Street’s demands. Having led large management consulting engagements over the past 2 decades with GE, Bank of America, BlackRock, Merrill Lynch, SunTrust, etc."
"When you look at “capitalism” holistically, the challenges are significant. For as many benefits and positive attributes, there are as many parallel detriments."
"The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to 30 thousand today. #45 called 30,000 a sacred number. I don’t think that means what he thinks it means."

"- Work from anywhere with cloud-based word processors like Google Docs, or a simple notebook and pen."
"- Manage your own publicity so you only engage with outlets you're comfortable with.
- Put together your own marketing to oversee the representation of your book and your author brand.
- Set your own hours.
- Be your own boss."

"- Keep around 100% of your royalties (about 90% profit in most cases) compared to 15% or less with a commercial publisher.
- Maintain full creative control of the content and design of your finished product.
- Hold onto your copyright."
Why should I self-publish my book?
Where can I find more information about independent publishing?
"You'll need a little technical know-how (how to upload different kinds of documents, edit images, use KDP, etc.) and some free time to execute your project."
"It also might be a good fit for people who are ""control freaks"" and are uncomfortable with handing over their entire publishing project to a publishing house's internal development team."
"Indie authors do best when they are true ""go-getters"" who like to take charge and have the ambition and direction to get things done."
When is indie publishing appropriate?
"Who independently publishes?

Anybody who wants to. Some commercially published authors even opt to go indie after a while (probably in order to keep more of their royalty earnings). You, too, can become an independent author if you so choose."
Follow me I follow back !
"You'll have 100% control over the creative process, get to keep your copyright, and will receive 100% of the royalties from the the sale of the book in all versions (ebook, paperback, hardcover, audiobook, large print, etc.)."

"Indie publishing (a.k.a. ""self-publishing"") just means that you manage all the various aspects of planning, creating, editing, designing, publishing, and promoting your book instead of having a publisher do it for you."

"If we view agencies through the lens of “bodies for lease,” the picture becomes clear. Metrics such as A. strategic value, B. quality,  C. domain expertise are part of the equation; but, for most agencies, the C-Suite focuses the majority of their effort on financial performance"
"and a net margin operating objective of 18–24%. Regardless of proprietary SaaS tools that a digital agency may have in their portfolio, most agencies have an 80%+ ratio of reliance on services vs. licensing of SaaS products."
Agencies hire people with specific skills at a salary + benefits + overhead multiplier to arrive at a cost to return ratio. These skills are then sold to clients at a markup. An agency markup typically includes 2X with a target gross margin of 40–60%
Ouch.

3 months — Quarterly performance. Everything rides on quarterly performance. A financial performance “miss” means change. This change can be as simple as reductions in line item expenditures to as significant as layoffs.
"3 weeks per month — As months come to a close, the final week in many organizations is focused on reporting on the success or failure of the prior 3 weeks with the objective of course correction or reinforcement of successful performance."
"3 days per week is representative of the amount of effective effort put forth within a 5 day work week. This takes into consideration organization inefficiency — unproductive meeting culture, ineffective deadline adherence, poor communication, burdensome overhead."
